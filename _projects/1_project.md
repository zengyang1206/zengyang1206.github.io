The study finds that rural female entrepreneurs are more inclined to take digital entrepreneurship as a supplement to their lives and work, focusing on community group buying, micro-business, and short video operation, showing the characteristics of low cost, low threshold and low risk.

While online entrepreneurship has positive impact on rural women of fulfilling lives, balancing families, and pursuing themselves, it also brings them new dilemmas.
